# description

	your data is encrypted within the browser against man in the browser attack vectors.
	the login page is on a random hex and port, against bruth force vectors.
	the login server is alive only for a few minutes so no automation can try to hack your
	you login page.
	
	you can easlly implement your own crypto protocol, instead of the really simplified code
	that is in this project, in addition, you can change the varification parameters for the
	varification automation, easlly extensible with caffe or any other ML python librarys.
	
	The installation is straight forward, Once you run the run.sh, after the installation,
	you got a login portal running on your java local machine, on a port you specified
	(read the docs), all you need to do is to change your login href, at your html page
	to the address that the Balancer.jar is working on and you got the all machanisem 
	going for you.
	
	another Advantage is that all your login .logs are centralized in the same place,
	to easlly monitor your traffic, and block unwanted traffic to ytour servers.
